      <p>During the 1950s and 60s, many Kayōkyoku groups<br/>
         and singers gained experience performing on US military bases<br/>
          in Japan. Around the same time, Yakuza manager Kazuo Taoka<br/>
           reorganized the concert touring industry by treating the performers as professionals.<br/>
            Many of these performers later became key participants in the J-pop genre.</p>

    <h1>J-Pops influenced</h1>
    <p>In the early 1960s, some Japanese music became influenced by the American folk music revival<br/>
       this was called fōku (フォーク, "folk"), although the genre of music was mostly covers of original songs.<br/>
        In the late 1960s, The Folk Crusaders became famous and the underground music around that time became called fōku.<br/>
         As with enka, Japanese fōku singers Wataru Takada performed social satires In the early 1970s,<br/>
         the emphasis shifted from fōku's simple songs with a single guitar accompaniment to more complex musical arrangements known as New Music (ニューミュージック nyū myūjikku).<br/>
         Instead of social messages, the songs focused on more personal messages, such as love. In 1972,<br/>
         singer-songwriter Takuro Yoshida produced a hit song "Kekkon Shiyouyo" ("Let's marry") without decent television promotion,<br/>
         though fans of fōku music became very angry because his music seemed to be a mersh music.<br/>
         The highest-selling single of the year was the enka song by Shiro Miya and the Pinkara Trio, "Onna no Michi". The song eventually sold over 3.25 million copies.<br/>
         On December 1, 1973, Yōsui Inoue released the album Kōri no Sekai, which topped the Oricon charts and remained in Top 10 for 113 weeks.<br/>
         It spent 13 consecutive weeks in the number-one spot, and eventually established a still-standing record of a total 35 weeks at the number-one position on the Oricon charts.<br/>
         Yumi Matsutoya, formerly known by her maiden name Yumi Arai, also became a notable singer-songwriter during this period In October 1975,<br/>
         she released a single "Ano Hi ni Kaeritai" ("I want to return to that day"),<br/>
         making it her first number-one single on the Oricon charts.[54] Miyuki Nakajima, Amii Ozaki, and Junko Yagami were also popular singer-songwriters during this period.<br/>
         At first, only Yumi Matsutoya was commonly called a New Music artist, but the concept of Japanese fōku music changed around that time.<br/>
         In 1979, Chage and Aska made their debut, and folk band Off Course (with singer Kazumasa Oda) released a hit song "Sayonara" ("Good-bye").</p>
